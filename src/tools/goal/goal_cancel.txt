Goal Cancellation Tool

Use this tool to cancel or abandon the current goal without completing it. This is useful when the goal is no longer relevant or needs to be redefined.

**Parameters:**
- `reason`: Optional explanation for why the goal is being cancelled (optional)

**Usage:**
Cancel the current goal:
```
goal_cancel(reason="Requirements changed, need to reassess")
```

**What happens:**
- Current goal is marked as completed (cancelled state)
- Cancellation reason is recorded if provided
- Goal is removed from active tracking

**Notes:**
- Only works if there's an active goal
- Provide a reason for better tracking and context
- Consider setting a new goal after cancellation
- Unlike goal_done, this indicates the goal wasn't fully achieved
