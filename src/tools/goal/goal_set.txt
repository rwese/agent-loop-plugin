Goal Setting Tool

Use this tool to set a new goal for the current session. A goal helps the agent stay focused on the primary objective by defining what success looks like.

**Parameters:**
- `title`: A short, clear title for the goal (required)
- `done_condition`: Description of what constitutes goal completion (required)
- `description`: Optional detailed description of the goal (optional)

**Usage:**
Set a goal when starting a new task to keep the agent focused:
```
goal_set(
  title="Fix login bug",
  done_condition="User can successfully log in with correct credentials",
  description="Investigate and fix the authentication issue preventing users from logging in"
)
```

**Notes:**
- Only one active goal per session
- Use goal_done when the completion condition is met
- Use goal_cancel to abandon the current goal
