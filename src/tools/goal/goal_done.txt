Goal Completion Tool

Use this tool to mark the current goal as successfully completed. This signals that the done condition has been met and the objective has been achieved.

**Usage:**
Call when the goal's completion criteria are satisfied:
```
goal_done()
```

**What happens:**
- Current goal status changes from "active" to "completed"
- Completion timestamp is recorded
- Goal remains visible but marked as done

**Notes:**
- Only works if there's an active goal
- Use this to formally close out a goal
- The completed goal can still be viewed via goal_status
- Consider setting a new goal after completion
